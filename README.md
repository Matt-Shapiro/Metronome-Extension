# Metronome-Extension
In progress...

Bugs to fix:

Search suggestion bar does not reset when search for songs

Song information div is off center for certain songs

Search takes a few seconds to work because of a method I use to parse the corrupt xml Document that bpmdatabase gives

Files:

low.wav and high.wav are the sound files for the metronome

mn.js is the source code
